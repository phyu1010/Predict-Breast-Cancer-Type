# Predict-Breast-Cancer-Type
Predict the cancer type by some features with different algorithms

Normally, breast cancer was classifed as two types: benign and malignance. 

Now I am going to define the type by applying Clump Thickness,Uniformity of Cell Size,Uniformity of Cell Shape,Marginal Adhesion,Single Epithelial Cell Size,Bare Nuclei,Bland Chromatin,Normal Nucleoli,Mitoses, totally 9 features.

This is a supervised learning project with Logistic Regression, Knn, Decision Tree, Random Forest algorithms, in order to find the best way to classify the breast types.
